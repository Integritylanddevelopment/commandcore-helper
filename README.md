# 🧠 Command Core OS (CC.OS)

Command Core OS (CC.OS) is a next-generation intelligent automation system designed for modular agent coordination, proactive reasoning, and seamless protocol execution across a structured knowledge base. Built with a multi-agent architecture, CC.OS enables rapid data extraction, synthetic reasoning, and contextual decision-making—all orchestrated by intelligent AI agents with clearly defined roles and layered interactions.

---

## 🔧 Project Overview

**Purpose:**  
CC.OS is engineered as a cognitive command OS designed to control a swarm of intelligent agents through natural language prompts, structured goals, and command-line protocols.

**Core Features:**
- Modular Agent System (Primary, Secondary, Support)
- Flexible Multi-Tier Protocol Execution
- Integrated Role-Based Reasoning Engine
- Memory & Context Management System
- Extraction, Synthesis, and Report Generation
- Fast-Track Launch Protocol for MVP deployment

---

## 📁 Architecture Overview

### Agent Roles
- **Primary Agent**: Central decision-maker; processes commands and delegates.
- **Secondary Agents**: Specialized sub-processors for logic chains, memory retrieval, or analysis.
- **Support Agents**: Autonomous tools or micro-agents performing atomic tasks.

### Command Flow
- User input → Command Parsing → Task Allocation → Agent Collaboration → Output Generation

### Key Modules
- `Agent Core`: Role logic, conversation state, and protocol execution
- `Extraction Layer`: For data mining and parsing
- `Protocol Engine`: Manages command syntaxes and structured instruction flow
- `Fast Track`: Optimized launch protocol for streamlined operations

## 📌 Features in Detail

### 🧠 Agent Logic
Described in `Agent Logic.txt`, agents operate on a layered decision tree:
- Tiered context awareness
- Memory-reinforced interactions
- Fall-back and escalation logic
- Role-based command parsing

### 📘 Bot Description
In `Bot description.txt`, the Command Core AI is defined as:
> A command-line-based AI supervisor of sub-agent systems that listens for structured goals, divides them into executable protocols, and launches reasoning chains through syntactical commands.

The design emphasizes:
- Decoupled agent control
- Prompt-based orchestration
- Conversation memory sync

### 🚀 Fast Track Launch
Outlined in `Fast Track launch.txt`, the system supports a bootstrapped operational mode with:
- Predefined command templates
- Dynamic goal-to-agent conversion
- Priority instruction routing
- Rapid output feedback loops

## 🏗️ Development Logs

Development was tracked across chronological logs:
- `CC.OS 1.txt` → Inception and primary agent creation
- `CC.OS 10.txt` → Intermediate logic refinement and testing
- `CC.OS 20.txt` → Finalization of protocols and output formatting

### Key Milestones:
- Agent type modularization
- Role transition logic
- Protocol layering (Contextual, Reactive, Declarative)

## 🧪 Example Usage

```bash
> [INSTRUCTION] Extract customer behavior trends from Q1 reports and summarize
# System:
-> Primary Agent launches Extraction Protocol
-> Secondary Agent mines reports
-> Support Agent generates summary
-> Final output: Summary file with tags and breakdown
