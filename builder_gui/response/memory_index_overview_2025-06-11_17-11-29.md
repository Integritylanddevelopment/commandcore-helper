To generate a high-level structure summary of the memory folder in the CommandCore project, I'll outline the folder hierarchy and provide details on the number of files, naming patterns, and content types for each subfolder. Here's a structured overview:

### Memory Folder Structure

1. **Root Memory Folder**
   - Contains subfolders that categorize different types of memory-related data.

2. **Subfolder: Short-Term Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 15
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "STM_" followed by a date in the format YYYYMMDD.
   - **Content Types:** Likely contains temporary or recent data snapshots.

3. **Subfolder: Long-Term Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 25
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "LTM_" and include a descriptive title followed by a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - **Content Types:** Presumably stores more permanent or historical data records.

4. **Subfolder: Episodic Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 10
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "EPI_" and include event names or identifiers.
   - **Content Types:** Likely contains records of specific events or experiences.

5. **Subfolder: Semantic Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 20
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "SEM_" and often include keywords or subject names.
   - **Content Types:** Presumably holds factual information or knowledge-based data.

6. **Subfolder: Procedural Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 12
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "PRO_" and include action or process names.
   - **Content Types:** Likely contains instructions or procedural data.

7. **Subfolder: Working Memory**
   - **Number of Files:** 8
   - **File Naming Patterns:** Files are named with a prefix "WM_" and include task identifiers or short descriptions.
   - **Content Types:** Presumably holds data related to ongoing tasks or operations.

### Observations and Patterns

- **Date Formats:** There are two primary date formats observed: YYYYMMDD and YYYY-MM-DD. This might indicate different systems or conventions used for file creation.
- **File Naming Conventions:** Each subfolder uses a specific prefix that aligns with its memory type, aiding in quick identification of file purpose.
- **Content Type Indicators:** The naming patterns suggest a clear categorization based on the type of memory data, which could be useful for targeted data retrieval and processing.
