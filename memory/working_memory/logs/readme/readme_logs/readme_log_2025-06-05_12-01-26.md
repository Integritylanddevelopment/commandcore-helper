# CommandCore Hub

CommandCore-Hub is a local, persistent memory system for coordinating development of the CommandCore OS. 
It preserves logs, scripts, and references so that ongoing ChatGPT sessions can pick up where they left off.

## Quick Start

1. **Index your files:**  
   Run `python scripts/index_memory_whoosh.py` to build the Whoosh index.

2. **Launch the Hub:**  
   Run `python core/launcher/launcher.py` and follow the prompts.

3. **Search the index:**  
   - In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to run the CLI search task.
   - Or run `python scripts/search_index_whoosh.py "your query"` (add `--fuzzy` for fuzzy search).

## Folder Overview

1. **memory/**  
   - Stores summaries of past work or crucial references. 
   - ChatGPT can refer to these to continue context seamlessly.

2. **logs/**  
   - Holds Markdown logs for each session or build. 
   - Use a new log file whenever you perform major tasks.

3. **scripts/**  
   - Collection of `.bat` scripts to automate tasks such as:
     - **launch_commandcore.bat**: Starts the hub and optionally syncs to GitHub.
     - **firebase_deploy.bat**: Deploys to Firebase, saving success/error logs.
     - **sync_to_github.bat**: Commits and pushes local changes to GitHub using your PAT.
     - **generate_readme_from_logs.py**: Creates an auto-generated README from your logs.

4. **core/launcher/**  
   - Contains the main launcher script for CommandCore.
