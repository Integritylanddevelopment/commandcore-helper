# CommandCore Hub

CommandCore-Hub is a local, persistent memory system for coordinating development of the CommandCore OS. 
It preserves logs, scripts, and references so that ongoing ChatGPT sessions can pick up where they left off.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Index your files:**  
   Run `python scripts/index_memory_whoosh.py` to build the Whoosh index.

2. **Launch the Hub:**  
   Run `python core/launcher/launcher.py` and follow the prompts.

3. **Search the index:**  
   - In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to run the CLI search task.
   - Or run `python scripts/search_index_whoosh.py "your query"` (add `--fuzzy` for fuzzy search).

---

## Folder Overview

1. **memory/**  
   - Stores summaries of past work or crucial references. 
   - ChatGPT can refer to these to continue context seamlessly.

2. **logs/**  
   - Holds Markdown logs for each session or build. 
   - Use a new log file whenever you perform major tasks.

3. **scripts/**  
   - Collection of `.bat` scripts to automate tasks such as:
     - **launch_commandcore.bat**: Starts the hub and optionally syncs to GitHub.
     - **firebase_deploy.bat**: Deploys to Firebase, saving success/error logs.
     - **sync_to_github.bat**: Commits and pushes local changes to GitHub using your PAT.
     - **generate_readme_from_logs.py**: Creates an auto-generated README from your logs.

4. **core/launcher/**  
   - Contains the main launcher script for CommandCore.

# üìê CommandCore-Hub Lightweight Schema

This schema defines the structure of the lightweight memory-enabled CommandCore-Hub system. It is optimized for Visual Studio and acts as a persistent memory shell to support CommandCore OS development.

---

## üóÇ Folder Structure

- `/scripts/`  
  Automation scripts for deploy, push, sync operations.

- `/memory/`  
  Stores logs, backups, AI-readable summaries, and dev context files.

- `/launcher/`  
  Contains `launcher.py`, the CLI or GUI entry point to the system.

- `/logs/`  
  Execution logs, auto-populated by scripts.

- `.env.template`  
  Template for environment variables. Rename to `.env` and fill with actual secrets.

- `README.md`  
  Main hub instructions.

- `2_README.md`  
  Memory system purpose, usage tips, and assistant reboot logic.

---

## üß† Memory Vault Purpose

- Acts as an external memory anchor for ChatGPT sessions.
- Includes backup scripts, assistant prompts, and historical context files.
- Located in `D:/ActiveProjects/CommandCore-Hub_v2025.01.01/`.

---

## üß∞ Optional Scripts (not always present)

- `CommandCore_Storage_Optimizer.bat`
- `firebase_deploy_CC.OS_Firebase.bat`
- `firebase_deploy_TogetherWe_Firebase.bat`

# Scripts Documentation

Below is a list of each script in `/HUB_scripts/` and its purpose:

## auto_document.py

Generates documentation for the project by scanning files for docstrings and comments. Outputs the documentation in Markdown format.

## deploy_commandcore.bat

Batch script to deploy the CommandCore system. Automates deployment tasks.

## extract_scripts.py

Scans text files in `/memory/` for Markdown code blocks (triple backticks). Extracts each code block into a separate file within `/logs/extracted_scripts/`.

## firebase_deploy.bat

Batch script to deploy the project to Firebase. Handles Firebase-specific deployment tasks.

## generate_readme_from_logs.py

Scans the `/logs/` directory for session logs and compiles them into a README-friendly summary. Saves or prints output to the console.

## index_memory_whoosh.py

Creates a Whoosh-based full-text search index from the files in `/memory/`. Files indexed include `.md`, `.txt`, and `.log`.

## merge_logs.py

Searches for duplicate or overlapping logs in `/memory/` and `/logs/`. Merges them to ensure a clean, non-redundant set of files.

## run_all.bat

Batch script to execute all key processes in sequence. Useful for initializing or testing the system.

## search_index_whoosh.py

Searches the Whoosh index created by `index_memory_whoosh.py`. Supports context lines and ANSI highlighting for matched terms.

## summarize_sessions.py

Generates a simple summarization of each file in `/memory/`. Saves the result to `/logs/session_summaries.md`.

## sync_to_gdrive.py

Scans text files in `/memory/` for Markdown code blocks and extracts them into `/logs/extracted_scripts/`.

## test_openai.py

Tests the OpenAI API integration. Useful for debugging and verifying API functionality.

## validate_hub.py

Checks for the required CommandCore-Hub folder structure and exits with an error code if something is missing.
