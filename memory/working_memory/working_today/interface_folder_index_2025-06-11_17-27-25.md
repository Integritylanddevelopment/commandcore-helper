Certainly! Below is a hypothetical structure of the "interface" folder within the CommandCore project. This structure outlines the files and subfolders, along with their types and naming conventions:

```
/interface
    /assets
        /images
            - logo.png
            - background.jpg
        /icons
            - home.svg
            - settings.svg
    /components
        - Header.jsx
        - Footer.jsx
        - Sidebar.jsx
        - Button.jsx
        - Modal.jsx
    /layouts
        - MainLayout.jsx
        - DashboardLayout.jsx
    /pages
        - HomePage.jsx
        - DashboardPage.jsx
        - SettingsPage.jsx
        - ProfilePage.jsx
    /styles
        - main.css
        - layout.css
        - components.css
    /utils
        - helpers.js
        - constants.js
    /routing
        - AppRouter.jsx
        - routes.js
    index.js
    App.jsx
```

### Naming Conventions:
- **Folders**: Use lowercase naming (e.g., `assets`, `components`, `layouts`).
- **Files**: Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `Header.jsx`, `MainLayout.jsx`) and camelCase for utility files (e.g., `helpers.js`, `constants.js`).
- **File Extensions**: `.jsx` for React components, `.js` for JavaScript utility files, `.css` for stylesheets, and common image formats like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg` for assets.

### Likely Components:
- **UI Views**: Found in the `/pages` folder, representing different screens or views of the application.
- **Layouts**: Found in the `/layouts` folder, likely used to structure the overall page layout.
- **Reusable Components**: Located in the `/components` folder, these are smaller, reusable UI elements like buttons, modals, headers, etc.
- **Assets**: Stored in the `/assets` folder, containing images and icons used throughout the UI.
- **Styles**: Contained in the `/styles` folder, these files define the visual styling of the application.
- **Routing Logic**: Managed in the `/routing` folder, which includes the main router component and route definitions.

This structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and scale the front-end interface of the CommandCore system.
