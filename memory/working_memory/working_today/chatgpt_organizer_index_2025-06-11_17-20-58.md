To document the structure of the `chatgpt_organizer` module within the CommandCore project, let's outline the typical organization and contents you might find in such a folder. This will help in understanding how the module is structured and how it interacts with the rest of the system.

### Structure Overview

1. **Subfolders and Their Roles:**
   - **agents/**: This folder likely contains files related to different agents or bots that the system uses. These could be Python scripts or configuration files that define the behavior and capabilities of each agent.
     - **File Types**: `.py` (Python scripts), `.json` or `.yaml` (configuration files)
     - **Example Files**: `agent_1.py`, `agent_config.yaml`
   
   - **templates/**: This folder probably holds template files used for generating responses or other outputs. These templates might be in a format that allows for dynamic content insertion.
     - **File Types**: `.html`, `.txt`, `.md` (Markdown)
     - **Example Files**: `response_template.html`, `email_template.txt`
   
   - **system_logic/**: This directory is likely where the core logic of the chatgpt_organizer is implemented. It might include algorithms, processing scripts, and main application logic.
     - **File Types**: `.py`
     - **Example Files**: `main.py`, `processor.py`
   
   - **shared_resources/**: This folder might contain resources that are used across different parts of the module, such as utility functions, constants, or shared data.
     - **File Types**: `.py`, `.json`, `.csv`
     - **Example Files**: `utils.py`, `constants.py`, `data.csv`

2. **Naming Patterns:**
   - Files are likely named according to their function or the specific feature they implement. For example, `agent_1.py` might correspond to a specific agent, while `main.py` could be the entry point for the system logic.
   - Configuration files might be named to reflect their purpose, such as `agent_config.yaml` for agent settings.

3. **File Extensions:**
   - **`.py`**: Python scripts for logic, agents, utilities, etc.
   - **`.json` / `.yaml`**: Configuration files that define settings and parameters.
   - **`.html` / `.txt` / `.md`**: Template files for generating formatted outputs.

### Interaction with the System

- **Agents**: These are likely the components that interact with users or other systems. They might use templates to format responses and rely on shared resources for data or utility functions.
- **Templates**: Used by agents or system logic to produce consistent outputs, ensuring that responses or documents adhere to a predefined format.
- **System Logic**: This is the core of the module, orchestrating the interaction between agents, processing inputs, and generating outputs.
- **Shared Resources**: Provide common functionality or data that can be accessed by multiple parts of the module, promoting code reuse and consistency.

This structure suggests a modular design where each part of the system has a clear role, facilitating maintenance and scalability. The organization into subfolders allows for separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and develop each component independently.
