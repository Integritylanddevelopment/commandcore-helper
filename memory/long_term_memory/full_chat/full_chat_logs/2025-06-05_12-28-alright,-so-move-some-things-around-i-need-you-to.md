_**User**_

Alright, so move some things around. I need you to list out for me all of the scripts without a bunch of explanation. Just the names of the scripts that are in the memory folder. All of them.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the scripts in the `` folder:

- `orchestrator.py`
- `index_memory_whoosh.py`
- `index_memory.py`
- `search_index_whoosh.py`
- `search_query_runner.py`

---

_**User**_

OK I need all the scripts that are in the memory folder including nested inside of any folders under the memory folder.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are all the scripts in the `` folder, including nested ones:

- `orchestrator.py`
- `index_memory_whoosh.py`
- `index_memory.py`
- `search_index_whoosh.py`
- `search_query_runner.py`
- `write_full_chat_content.py`
- `extract_scripts.py`

---

_**User**_

orchestrator.py
index_memory_whoosh.py
index_memory.py
search_index_whoosh.py
search_query_runner.py
write_full_chat_content.py
 right full chat content pie
 extract scripts pie
 Auto document pie
 merge logs pie
 update session log pie
 index memory woosh pie
 index memory pie
 orchestrator pie
 search index woosh pie
 search query Runner pie
 summarize scripts pie
 orchestrator pie
 these are all of the scripts that I have under the memory folder nested within other folders or nested in the nested but here's the thing we need to figure out the order of which ones these fire and what their actual purpose is because actually let's figure out the purpose first then we're going to go out and figure out the order in which they need a fire depending on the purpose cuz here's the thing right now you've got nothing happening the way that it's supposed to whatever we ran the orchestrator pie you said it triggered all of the other scripts in the memory folder but there's nothing in the search log so that means we need the need we need to put something in there that creates a markdown and and where it stores it so where it gets its information from create a markdown and then wear it writes the information too so I think probably create a markdown is the first one so be creative work down go get the information from where it gets it then write the information on the markdown and then from the information that's on the markdown it needs to write the name so first off let's figure out for all of these Scripts we're going to make a list and go one by one where does it get its information from what does it do to the information and where does it write the information to hey so why don't you take a stab at that and see if you can just here in the chat make me a list of where each script gets us information from what it does to the information and where it writes it to

OK. I've got this floating badge over my tree whenever I am like trying to mess around with the folder tree and I can't see the whole folder tree or I can't see the code because it got this stupid floating badge that keeps popping up. It says D, active projects, command, core hub, all this kind of stuff. Can you help me change the settings Jason, or where the hell I need to do so that I don't have that little floating badge anymore?

---

_**Assistant**_

To remove the floating badge in your folder tree, you can adjust the settings in your `settings.json` file. Specifically, you can disable the workspace folder name badge by adding the following setting:

```json
"explorer.compactFolders": false
```

This setting ensures that the folder tree is displayed without unnecessary badges or compacting. Let me update your `settings.json` file for you.

_**User**_

OK well, I've got it here in the chat too. Can you stop it from being in the chat?

---

_**Assistant**_

To stop the floating badge from appearing in the chat, you can disable the workspace folder name badge in the settings. This is already handled by the `"explorer.compactFolders": false` setting in your `settings.json`. If the issue persists, it might be related to another setting or extension. Let me know if you need further assistance!

---

_**User**_

Can you do that in the Jason settings? Settings jason, that's open right now?

---

_**Assistant**_

To stop the floating badge from appearing in the chat, you can add the following setting to your `settings.json` file:

```json
"workbench.editor.decorations.badges": false
```

This disables the badges in the editor. Let me update your `settings.json` file for you.

_**User**_

Thank you. Can I just save it and and it'll stop doing it?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the changes you made to the `settings.json` file are automatically saved in VS Code. Once saved, the settings should take effect immediately, and the floating badge should stop appearing. If it still shows up, try restarting VS Code to ensure the changes are applied. Let me know if you need further help!

---

_**User**_

I still have the floating badge.

---

_**Assistant**_

If the floating badge is still appearing, it might be caused by another setting or an extension. Let’s try disabling another related setting that could be causing this issue. I’ll add the following to your `settings.json`:

```json
"workbench.editor.labelFormat": "short"
```

This will simplify the labels in the editor and might resolve the issue. Let me update it for you.
