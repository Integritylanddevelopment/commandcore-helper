Look at this copilot chat capture PI and tell me if I put in the import sub process at the end to kick off the next script to trigger the summary pie. Tell me if I did it right.

Yes, you have correctly added the `subprocess` import and used it at the end of the script to trigger the summary script. The `main()` function includes the necessary logic to call the summary script using `subprocess.run`. Here's the relevant part of your code:

```python
import subprocess

def main():
    # ...existing code for chat logging...
    print("âœ… Chat logging completed. Triggering summary script...")
    
    # Trigger the summary script
    summary_script_path = r"d:\ActiveProjects\CommandCore-Hub_v2025.01.01\memory\logs\summary\summary_scripts\summary.py"
    subprocess.run(["python", summary_script_path], check=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Points:
1. **Import Statement**: You correctly imported `subprocess` at the top of the file.
2. **Script Execution**: The `subprocess.run` function is used with the `check=True` argument, which ensures that an exception is raised if the script fails.
3. **Path to Script**: The path to the summary script is correctly specified as a raw string (`r""`) to avoid issues with backslashes.

This implementation should work as intended to trigger the summary script after the chat logging is completed.
